        <h5>Act II</h5>
        <h5>SCENE I.--ARISTE (_leaving_ CLITANDRE, _and still speaking to
            him_).</h5>
        
        <p>SCENE III.--BÃ‰LISE (_entering softly and listening_), CHRYSALE,
            ARISTE.
            
            ARI. Clitandre has chosen me to be his interpreter to you; he has
            fallen in love with Henriette.
            
            CHRY. What! with my daughter?
            
            ARI. Yes. Clitandre is delighted with her, and you never saw a lover
            so smitten!
            
            BEL. (_to_ ARISTE). No, no; you are mistaken. You do not know the
            story, and the thing is not as you imagine.
            
            ARI. How so, sister?
            
            BEL. Clitandre deceives you; it is with another that he is in love.
            
            ARI. It is not with Henriette that he is in love? You are joking.
            
            BEL. No; I am telling the perfect truth.
            
            ARI. He told me so himself.
            
            BEL. Doubtless.
            
            ARI. You see me here, sister, commissioned by him to ask her of her
            father.
            
            BEL. Yes, I know.
            
            ARI. And he besought me, in the name of his love, to hasten the time
            of an alliance so desired by him.
            
            BEL. Better and better. No more gallant subterfuge could have been
            employed. But let me tell you that Henriette is an excuse, an
            ingenious veil, a pretext, brother, to cover another flame, the
            mystery of which I know; and most willingly will I enlighten you both.
            
            ARI. Since you know so much, sister, pray tell us whom he loves.
            
            BEL. You wish to know?
            
            ARI. Yes; who is it?  BEL. Me!
            
            ARI. You!
            
            BEL. Myself.
            
            ARI. Come, I say! sister!</p>
